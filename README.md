# Clearos-translation
This project provides the translation of ClearOS in different languages.

## How to merge translation?
As by default ClearOS-language folder is located in `/usr/clearos/apps/base/language/` with language-specific subfolders such as `en_US/` and `sk/`, you have to pick one folder you want to merge from this project (i.e. `fr/`) and move it in.

## How to contribute?
If you want to contribute translating ClearOS in a new language, follow these steps:
1. Fork it (it's obvious ;-))
2. Create a new folder named by the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) code (i.e. for swahili `sw`, for lingala `ln`...)
3. Start translating the `base_lang.php` file
4. Make a PR (it's obvious, too ;-))
